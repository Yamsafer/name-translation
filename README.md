# name-translation

Transliterate the names in your content, donâ€™t translate


## Getting Started

This package is constructed to allow users to translate names from a source language to a target language with two possible
connections (Rosette ,Google Translate).

After downloading the package, you need to set your API KEYs for the previously mentioned connections in the configuration file (config/name-translation.php).

Also, you need to assign them in the test file (tests/NameTranslation/TranslatioTest) if you want to run the used tests in the package.

By default,the translation will be held with the Rosette Connection from English to Arabic.

You can use the main method translate($name, $source, $target),
which take three parameters as
$name => The given name that you want to translate (must be given)
$source => The source language (optional _default = arabic);
$target => The source language (optional _default = english).
